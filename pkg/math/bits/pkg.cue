// At returns the value of the i'th bit of x.

// Set sets and returns x with x's i'th bit set to b (0 or 1).
// That is, if b is 1 Set returns x with its i'th bit set;

Set: func(x: int, i: int, bit: int) -> int

// And sets and returns a to the bitwise "and" of a and b.
And: func(a: int, b: int) -> int

// Or sets and returns a to the bitwise "or" of a and b (a | b in Go).
Or: func(a: int, b: int) -> int

// Xor sets and returns a to the bitwise xor of a and b (a ^ b in Go).

// Clear sets and returns a to the bitwise "and not" of a and b (a &^ b in Go).
Clear: func(a: int, b: int) -> int

// Len returns the length of the absolute value of x in bits. The bit length
